# Learning Center

Welcome to the Gruntwork Learning Center! In this category of documentation, you'll find information specific to patterns and practices Gruntwork use to simplify developing infrastructure as code. These patterns are leveraged in Gruntwork [products](../products.md), but we keep them documented separately because they can be applied generically outside of using Gruntwork products.
