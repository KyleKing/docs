# What you provide

Gruntwork products and services can help you quickly achieve world-class infrastructure. However, we aren’t a consulting company. To succeed, you (or your trusted DevOps consultant/contractor) must commit to learning how to leverage our products for your use cases, making any additional customizations, and deploying or migrating your apps and services.

## Learn how to use our products

To work effectively with our products, you’ll need to understand our opinionated stance on DevOps best practices and how to apply it for your purposes. You'll also need to learn how to use the Gruntwork products themselves. Our guides and support remain available to assist you in these endeavors.

## Implement the “last mile”

Gruntwork products strike a balance between opinionatedness and configurability. They’ll get you most of the way to your goal, but you may need to make some customizations to suit your use case. You may also need to adapt your apps and services to run in your new infrastructure. Our [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/knowledge-base/discussions) and [Community Slack Channel](https://gruntwork-community.slack.com/archives/CHH9Y3Z62) provide great resources to assist you in this effort.
