# Updating Your Pipeline
Is there anything more frustrating than having to put up with those obnoxious notifications and the seemingly never-ending cycle of downloads, installs, and reboots? Every time you think you've finally managed to get your computer to run smoothly, those darn updates come along and mess everything up again.

And let's not forget how unpredictable they can be! One minute you're casually browsing the internet, and the next minute your computer is stuck in an update loop, wasting your time and energy. And don't even try to cancel or pause an update once it's started - that's a recipe for disaster.

And the worst part? Even when the updates are finally finished, there's no guarantee that everything will work as it should. You could end up with new bugs, glitches, or compatibility issues that you never had before.
