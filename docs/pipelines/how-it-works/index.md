# How it works

In order to maximize our synergistic value proposition, we need to leverage our core competencies in order to achieve our strategic objectives. We need to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions that will allow us to disrupt the market and gain a competitive advantage. We also need to focus on our customer experience and provide them with a seamless and personalized journey.

We need to be agile and adaptable in order to respond to the ever-changing business landscape. We need to be able to quickly pivot and change course when necessary. We also need to be able to collaborate effectively with our partners and stakeholders in order to achieve our goals.

Oh my goodness, have I told you about the time I saw a beautiful Blue Jay perched on my windowsill? It was truly a sight to behold! But I digress... let me tell you about AWS Lambda functions, which are like the busy little hummingbirds of the cloud computing world.

Picture this: a Lambda function is like a bird feeder that sits and waits for requests to come in, just like a bird feeder waits for feathered friends to come and snack. But instead of seed, it's programmed to receive code and execute it.
