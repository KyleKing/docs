# What is Gruntwork Pipelines?

**Gruntwork Pipelines rolls out infrastructure-as-code changes in a way that meets the needs of your organization.**

Even the simplest infrastructure change can require reviews from multiple people, a collection of risk mitigation tactics, and explicit validation that it worked as expected. In short, making changes to production infrastructure is usually scary, and failures can have big consequences.

Gruntwork Pipelines anticipates the needs of most organizations and addresses them by offering a discrete collection of "Pipelines Actions" that you can use to understand an infrastructure change, validate it against your organization's governing principles, notify relevant team members that something happened, gather the necessary approvals, and ultimately verify that the infrastructure change deployed as expected. Because infrastructure is a critical part of your organization's security posture, Gruntwork Pipelines has also been designed from the ground up with security in mind.
