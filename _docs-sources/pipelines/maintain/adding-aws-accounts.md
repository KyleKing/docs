# Adding AWS accounts

If your organization has a need for more than one `infrastructure-live` repository, there are two primary approaches to adding Pipelines support to additional repositories:

1. Create a new `infrastructure-pipelines` repository (though named something different) for the new `infrastructure-live` repository
1. Use a single `infrastructure-pipelines` repository for multiple `infrastructure-live` repositories.
