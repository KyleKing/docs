# How it works

TODO: Translate this into prose, or headers

- User opens a Pull Request
- Pipelines identifies all infra-changes being proposed
- For each infra-change, Pipelines runs the relevant Pipelines Actions
- The results of these actions show up as commnets and check runs in the GitHub Pull Request
- [Future] Configure Pipelines to run different Pipelines Actions.
