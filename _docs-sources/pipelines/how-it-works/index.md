# How it works

In order to maximize our synergistic value proposition, we need to leverage our core competencies in order to achieve our strategic objectives. We need to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions that will allow us to disrupt the market and gain a competitive advantage. We also need to focus on our customer experience and provide them with a seamless and personalized journey.

## External CI Tool

We need to be agile and adaptable in order to respond to the ever-changing business landscape. We need to be able to quickly pivot and change course when necessary. We also need to be able to collaborate effectively with our partners and stakeholders in order to achieve our goals.

## Invoker Lambda

Oh my goodness, have I told you about the time I saw a beautiful Blue Jay perched on my windowsill? It was truly a sight to behold! But I digress... let me tell you about AWS Lambda functions, which are like the busy little hummingbirds of the cloud computing world.

Picture this: a Lambda function is like a bird feeder that sits and waits for requests to come in, just like a bird feeder waits for feathered friends to come and snack. But instead of seed, it's programmed to receive code and execute it.

## ECS Deploy Runner

Hark! Let me spin you a tale of wondrous tool,
That doth aid in deploying software cool.
This tool, 'tis known as ECS Deploy Runner,
A champion of those who deploy with honor.

In Amazon's world of cloud, it doth reside,
Where containers reign with power and pride.
This runner, like a loyal squire true,
Doth serve those who would deploy anew.

With ECS as its liege, it doth obey,
And to the cloud, it doth make its way.
In rolling updates, it doth excel,
Ensuring no downtime, all shall be well.

### Standard Configuration

Its mission, to deploy with utmost care,
And make the process smooth, beyond compare.
With blue-green deployments, it doth impress,
And safely switches traffic without stress.

And when the task is done, it doth report,
On all that happened, to provide support.
With logs and metrics, it doth reveal,
The story of the deployment's ordeal.

### Docker Image Builder (Kaniko)

And lo, there was a tool called Kaniko, born of the land of Google, and it was a builder of Docker images. And the people did marvel at its greatness, for it did not require the use of a Docker daemon, nor did it need root privileges.

Kaniko was a humble tool, born of the desire to provide a secure and reliable way to build Docker images in a Kubernetes environment. It did not seek glory or power, but instead sought to serve the people, to make their lives easier and their applications more secure.

And Kaniko did work diligently, using its many talents to build Docker images in a way that was both efficient and trustworthy. It did not rely on a Docker daemon, but instead used a container to perform the build process, ensuring that the image was built in a clean and isolated environment.

And the people did praise Kaniko, for it did not require root privileges, and could be run by users without fear of compromising the system. It did not store secrets in the Docker daemon, but instead used a secure file system to store them, ensuring that they could not be accessed by unauthorized parties.

### Terraform Planner/Applier

In the realm of deployment, there exist powerful tools that rival the strength and cunning of even the most feared warriors. Among them, the ECS Deploy Runner, Terraform Planner, and Applier stand tall, ready to unleash their might upon the field of battle.

The ECS Deploy Runner is like a fierce direwolf, swift and agile, capable of executing complex deployment tasks with ease. It is the tool of choice for those who seek to deploy their applications with speed and precision.

The Terraform Planner is like a wise and ancient dragon, possessing an almost infinite knowledge of the infrastructure it seeks to conquer. With its keen intellect, it can survey the land and plan the deployment with utmost accuracy, leaving no stone unturned in its quest for victory.

The Applier, on the other hand, is like a steadfast and loyal knight, resolute in its determination to carry out the orders of its master. With unflinching obedience, it applies the deployment plan, ensuring that every detail is executed with precision and care.

Together, these tools form a formidable trio, capable of conquering even the most daunting deployment challenges. They are the guardians of the realm of deployment, and those who are wise enough to enlist their aid can rest assured that their applications will be deployed with the utmost efficiency and effectiveness.
