# Supported CI systems

Today, Gruntwork Pipelines works exclusively with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

However, the [Gruntwork Pipelines architecture](../how-it-works) is designed to be agnostic to the underlying CI system, so we will add support for other CI systems in the future.
