# docs-fetcher

The purpose of docs-fetcher is to fetch the files in each of the Gruntwork git repos that correspond to an Infrastructure 
Package, along with markdown files in the `/content` folder of this repo, and combine them all into a single folder. 

This allows another tool to consume just one folder to generate the entire public documentation site.
